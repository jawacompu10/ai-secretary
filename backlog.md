Looking at my current tools as your smart secretary, I have a solid foundation but there are definitely gaps. Here's my assessment:

# Current Tools (Strong Foundation):
✅ Calendar Management: Create calendars, events, recurring meetings, reschedule, cancel
✅ Task Management: Add, complete, edit due dates, organize by calendar
✅ Time Management: Get current time, schedule optimization
✅ Journal Management: Create, edit and delete journals to document and track progress of tasks

# Missing Tools That Would Make Me More Effective:
## 🔔 Communication & Notifications:

**Email integration** - Read, send, draft emails, manage inbox
**Slack/Teams integration** - Send messages, check status, coordinate with team
**SMS/messaging** - Send reminders, quick updates

## 📁 File & Document Management:

Google Drive/OneDrive - Access, organize, share documents
Document creation - Generate reports, meeting notes, action items
File organization - Auto-categorize, backup important files

## 🎯 Smart Automation:

Meeting preparation - Auto-generate agendas, prep materials
Follow-up automation - Track action items, send reminders
Context switching - Remember conversation history, project status

## 📊 Advanced Analytics:

Time tracking - Analyze how you spend time, suggest optimizations
Productivity metrics - Task completion rates, meeting efficiency
Goal tracking - Progress toward objectives, milestone reminders

## 🤖 Proactive Intelligence:

Conflict detection - Spot scheduling issues before they happen
Priority recommendations - AI-driven task prioritization based on deadlines/impact
Resource optimization - Suggest when to batch similar tasks

## ⚙️ Configuration & Provider Management:

**Calendar Provider Configuration** - Add settings.toml configuration to specify which calendar provider to use (CalDAV, Google Calendar, Microsoft Exchange, etc.) with provider-specific settings and credentials. This would allow users to switch between different calendar backends without code changes.

Bottom line: I'm quite capable for scheduling and task management, but adding communication tools and document access would make me significantly more valuable as your comprehensive smart secretary. What areas would be most helpful for your daily workflow?
